# Language Exchange Product Functionality

## Matching Users
The Language Exchange allows users to select their:  
1. Native Language  
2. Foreign Language (language they want to learn)  

Users with the exact opposite Native and Foreign languages will be matched up and connected with each other. For example:

Jing:
* Native Language - Chinese
* Foreign Language - English

Joe:
* Native Language - English
* Foreign Language - Chinese

Jacque:
* Native Language - French
* Foreign Language - Chinese

In this scenario, Jing and Joe will be matched and connected while Jacque would not be matched with either Jing or Joe.

## User Interaction

When users are connected, they can interact with each other via video chat and message chat.

### Video Chat
After users are matched, a video element will appear on the Language Exchange showing the user's language partner. Users can speak to each other over the video chat.

### Message Chat
After users are matched, a chat box will appear on the Language Exchange. Users can exchange messages through the chat box. Incoming messages will be translated by Google Translate into the user's native language.
