# Language Exchange Product Functionality

## Matching Users
The Language Exchange looks to match users based on their native language and foreign language (language they want to learn).
Users will select their:  
1. Native Language  
2. Foreign Language 

Users with the exact opposite Native and Foreign languages will be connected with each other. For example:

Jing:
* Native Language - Chinese
* Foreign Language - English

Joe:
* Native Language - English
* Foreign Language - Chinese

Jacque:
* Native Language - French
* Foreign Language - Chinese

In this scenario, Jing (speaks Chinese, wants to learn English) and Joe (speaks English, wants to learn Chinese) will be connected. Jacque would not be connected with either Jing or Joe.

## User Interaction

When users are connected, they can interact with each other via video chat and message chat.

### Video Chat
After users are matched, a video element will appear on the Language Exchange showing the user's language partner. Users can speak to each other over the video chat.

### Message Chat
After users are matched, a chat box will appear on the Language Exchange. Users can exchange messages through the chat box. Incoming messages will be translated by Google Translate into the user's native language.
