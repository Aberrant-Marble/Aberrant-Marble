User Model:

Currently, users do NOT have to sign up or sign in to use Language Exchange. 

However, as of 2/2/2015, a user model has been created for future plans to implement future features that require persistent data. A future feature could be to save chats in a user's history so that users can go back to conversations they've had over instant message.

Facebook integration is currently implemented via [passport](http://passportjs.org/guide/facebook/), and saved to the user model via their facebookId.
